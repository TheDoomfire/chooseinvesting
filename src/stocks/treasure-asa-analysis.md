<p>
    Treasure only has one holding <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/086280:KRX?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiK-Iq47_z2AhWMv4sKHcifDEUQ3ecFegQIOxAi" target="_blank">Hyundai Glovis</a> and that’s making us not receiving the safety of <a href=”https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversification.asp” target=”_blank”>diversification</a>
</p>

<p>
    Other than that I don’t quite know why it’s selling so low. Let’s find out and get straight to business.

<h2 id="netassetvalue">Net Asset Value</h2>

<p>
    According to my calculations there is a 39% NAV discount on the underlying assets, give or take.
</p>

<p>
    Which makes this stock a possible bargain and is the reason why I even started this analysis.
</p>

<p>
    Without this big discount I would not consider this stock and doing an analysis as I’m doing now.
</p>

<h2 id="equityratio">Equity Ratio</h2>

<p>
    99.9998% Own equity according to the 2021 annual report.
</p>

<p>
    Basically no loans at all and that means no struggling with paying interest or anything like that. Less risk for us.
</p>

<p>
    But no additional <a href=”https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp” target=”_blank”>leverage</a>. But when you loan money and the underlying asset also has loans it can mean much added risk.
</p>

<h2 id="underlyingasset">The Underlying Asset</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.glovis.net/Eng/ir/communityid/12/list.do" target="_blank">Hyundai Glovis</a> is their underlying asset. Buying Treasure basically just means buying Hyundai Glovis but at another price.
</p>

<p>
    So let’s try to value it. Treasure is essentially Hyundai Glovis but at a lower price.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
    Steady increase of sales, corona (2020) hit but not hard at all. <span class="text-plus">85%</span> total over 10 years or a <span class="text-plus">6.3%</span> YoY increase. Not the best but stable and clearly growing every year.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
    Earnings are fluctuating which is normal and is totally okay especially when the net sales are steadily growing.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="text-plus">57%</span> Increase in 10 years or <span class="text-plus">4.6%</span> YoY Average. A lot of news talks about 20% you returns are stuff like that and if it’s true if you look only a few years back.
</p>

<p>
    But as we see here they still grow just probably not that much YoY. Looking at a longer period of time gives us a much more realistic picture.

<p>
    Not any unacceptable number since ever really. <span class="text-plus">10%</span> in 10 years is not that impressive but seems stable. Not any problems that required adding additional debt.
</p>
<p>
    The company seems to focus on their growth rather on lowering their debt. And leverage clearly is working and safely for this company.
</p>

<h3 id="assets">Assets</h3>

<p>
    According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/086280:KS">Bloomberg </a> the P/B is about 1.24.
</p>

<p>
    If I add up the cash & cash equivalents, other current financial assets & receivables and divide it by the assets I get about 0.43 meaning at least <span class="text-plus">43%</span> is somewhat tangible.
</p>

<p>
    I had a hard time seeing what assets are actually tangible so this has to do, at least for me.
</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>
    Treasure is an investment company that has 100% own equity and has only one underlying asset. Usually investment companies have several investments and diversify to spread out the risk.
</p>

<p>
    The underlying asset (Hyundai Glovis) is trading for about 40% less than Treasure is trading for. Which means you essentially buy Hyundai Glovis but at a <span class="text-plus">40%</span> discount with Treasure.
</p>

<p>
    Could I buy any stock for 40% less than the market, I would do it in a heartbeat.
</p>

<p>
    I assume treasure is trying to sell as much as possible without driving down the price and then doing buybacks and dividends. I mean it makes total sense in this case because of this huge discount.
</p>

<p>
    Hyundai Glovis is not that bad, they have been increasing their revenue steadily every year and about <span class="text-plus">85%</span> in 10 years total. About <span class="text-plus">6.3%</span> YoY.
</p>

<p>
    Their earnings are less impressive with <span class="text-plus">57%</span> 10year total and <span class="text-plus">4.6%</span> YoY.
</p>

<p>
    Their debt/equity is pretty okay and has barely moved over the years. Only about 10% decrease in 10 years.
</p>

<p>
    Hyundai Glovis doesn't seem so risky and a steady grower and earner. But do we take into account the 40% discount that Treasure provides, it's like Hyundai Glovis’s steroids.
</p>

<p>
    A 40% discount means that it has to increase about 65% to come back to that price.
</p>

<p>
    Is the P/E 9? It means you get it for 5.4. And that’s about what the P/E is now.
</p>

<p>
    The dividend yield that Treasure is providing is rather high 6%+ but half of that is from the dividends from Hyundai Glovis.
</p>
