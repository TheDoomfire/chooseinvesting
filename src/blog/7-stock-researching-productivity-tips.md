It’s always a good idea to try to increase our productivity since time is our greatest resource. And with less time spent doing basic tasks we can focus more on the things that yields the result.

I always try to make a small task work faster and rely on just saving small amount of time for a higher total saving.

These are the ones I use and there’s always room for improvement and with time some of these will change.

These tips will be improved and updated whenever I find something better or something to add.

<h2 id="screener">Use a Stock Screener</h2>

Stock screeners are a great tool to use to quickly find stocks that meets our criterias.

So we later on know what stocks deserve a deeper analyst.

All stocks is not on every stock screener so this is just a tool to try to automate some of the process. Keep that in mind.

Also most basic stock multipers show up on these so we can quickly see what the company has for a specific multiplier.

For example in some stock screeners we can sort by stock multipliers like P/E and if it’s higher than X we will simply not show it.

Setting more multipliers for example P/E under X and P/B under 1 could better find stocks that are more interesting since they fit our criterias.

<ul class="numbers">

<li>

Bloomberg Terminal

The professionals are using this but it’s very expensiv so not realtistic for us regular folk to use.

<h2 id="extentions">Browser Extentions</h2>

<h2 id="hotkeys">Use Hotkeys</h2>

Speeds up the process by knowing what to press for keys. Sometimes it’s way faster to press a few buttons than for example scroll.

<ul>

<li>

<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> - Find in Page

Just press this and then type in whatever you want to find in the webpage / document. For example if we want to find the revenue information we just write it in.

Apparently most users don’t know this one and I use it for every document I’ve ever read.

</li>

<li>

<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> - Select All

</li>

<li>

<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> - Copy Text

</li>

<li>

<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> - Paste Text

<li>

<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>+</kbd>/<kbd>-</kbd> - Zoom <kbd>+</kbd> in & <kbd>-</kbd> out

</li>

<li>

<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> - Target the searchbar

</li>

<li>

<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd>

In browsers go to next tab. We often find ourselves having many tabs open and this does indeed speed up the process.

</li>

<li>

<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd>-<kbd>9</kbd>

In browsers go to that tab.

</li>

<li>

<kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>TAB</kbd>

Change programs, for example the browser to a PDF reader.

</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="google">Google More Specific</h2>

Let’s say we want a report of a company. We can simple typ type in <abbr>Company Name * “Annual Report” filetype:pdf</abbr>  and it should be somewhere in the front page.

<abbr>*</abbr> is to fill in the blanks between words.

The parentheses <abbr>“”</abbr> and the search must cointaint that word or sentence.

<abbr>..</abbr> means within the range of 2020..2022.

So if we wouldnt see any annual reports we can type in <abbr>“annual report”</abbr>

Google something like <abbr>company name site:reddit.com</abbr> do only find in that specific webpage

Type <abbr>-</abbr> before a word to exclude it from search.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/advanced_search">Google Advanced Search</a>[](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5t3rk4/people_who_are_google_search_geniuses_what_is/)

Using forums like reddit could provide useful. Just make sure the forums are not bias, so I prefer reddit.

<h2 id="spreadsheets">Google Spreadsheets</h2>

Any Spreadsheets will do but I prefer google drive since it’s in the cloud

Since we sometimes have to calculate ourselves and rely on several years of data it’s alot easier to make a graph or just write them down.

Because it’s easy to forget or not see the whole picture.

<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>

Fixing our settings and making our device run more smoothly will in turn result in higher productivity.

In google we can change so for example every page we go into goes to a separate tab. Making us able to open up more pages for the same search. Or just use the middle mouse button.

In the browser we can set up startup pages, making us even more ready.

Startup programs in windows do so we have less annoying crap distracting us at the start of the computer and forcing us to have to turn it off

<h2 id="automation">Automation</h2>

The tool we use to conduct our research is a machine capable of automation. We always have to keep that in mind.

When we make our device work more smothless we will in turn do more productive research.

If we do repetitive tasks some can be automated, if not all. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/6-cool-uses-for-the-task-scheduler-in-windows-10/">Windows Task Scheduler</a> is a tool for some automation.

<a target="_blank" href="https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/">Power Automate</a> & AutoHotKey is also automation tools.

Whenever we do a repetitive task we have to think for ourself if a computer could do it. In some cases their are people that have already automated that task.
