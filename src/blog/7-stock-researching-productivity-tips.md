It’s always a good idea to try to increase our productivity since time is our greatest resource. And with less time spent doing basic tasks we can focus more on the things that yields the result.



I always try to make a small task work faster and rely on just saving small amount of time for a higher total saving.



These are the ones I use and there’s always room for improvement and with time some of these will change.



These tips will be improved and updated whenever I find something better or something to add.

<h2 id="screener">Use a Stock Screener</h2>

Stock screeners are a great tool to use to quickly find stocks that meets our criterias.

So we later on know what stocks deserve a deeper analyst.

All stocks is not on every stock screener so this is just a tool to try to automate some of the process. Keep that in mind.

Also most basic stock multipers show up on these so we can quickly see what the company has for a specific multiplier.

For example in some stock screeners we can sort by stock multipliers like P/E and if it’s higher than X we will simply not show it.

Setting more multipliers for example P/E under X and P/B under 1 could better find stocks that are more interesting since they fit our criterias.

<ul class="numbers">

<li>

Bloomberg Terminal

The professionals are using this but it’s very expensiv so not realtistic for us regular folk to use.

</li>

<li>

<a target="_blank" href="https://finviz.com/screener.ashx">Fitz</a>

Very populair screener that seems to be the favorite for most people

</li>

<li>

<a target="_blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/">Yahoo Finance</a>

Pretty common one aswell.

</li>

<li>

<a target="_blank" href="https://markets.ft.com/">Financial Times</a>

</li>

<li>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.barchart.com/stocks/stocks-screener">Bar chart</a>

</li>

</ul>

There is a lot more screeners and these are just some that I know of.

<h2 id="extentions">Browser Extentions</h2>

First of all use a good browser that supports Extentions/addons.

Not in any kind of order:

<ul>

<li>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>

</li>

</ul>

1. Chrome - mostly used, but in the google family 

Pros: Simple, minimal, google family, syncing, fast.

Cons: Not privacy respecting. Not entirely customisable.

2. Firefox - On android this supports extensions aswell

Pros: Good privacy, customizable, extensions available on android.

3. Opera
4. Brave
5. Vivaldi



Test the browser on speed-battle.com if you want the fastest.



1. uBlock Origin - Blocks adds and make us receive webapges without bloat. Youtube videos without ads.
2. I don't care about cookies -
3. Video Speed Controller -  With D and S key you can speed up any kind of video in your browser. Make us being able to skip boring content in videos. And increasing video speed by 10% does make us
4. Return YouTube Dislike - If a video has a lof of dislikes it is a warning that the video dosen’t probably fufill the promise of the title. Or something else is wrong.
5. SponsorBlock för YouTube - Skips sponsor and intro in youtube videos. Making us able to even faster see all the content.



Use Hotkeys



Speeds up the process by knowing what to press for keys. Sometimes it’s way faster to press a few buttons than for example scroll.



1. CTRL + F - Find in Page

Just press this and then type in whatever you want to find in the webpage / document. For example if we want to find the revenue information we just write it in.



Apparently most users don’t know this one and I use it for every document I’ve ever read.

2. CTRL + A, C, V

A - Focus all text

C - Copies it

V - Pasts it.

3. CTRL + +/- Zooms in or OUT
4. Ctrl + L targets the searchbar
5. CTRL + Shift - In browsers go to next tab. We often find ourselves having many tabs open and this does indeed speed up the process.
6. CTRL + 1-9 - In browsers go to that tab.
7. ALT + TAB - Change programs, for example the browser to a PDF reader.



YouTube has shortcuts aswell.

F - Fullscreen

Space - Play

Arrow Keys up & down - volume

Arrow Right & Left - fast forward/back 10sec

If you find it very interesting you can even create your own Hotkeys with AutoHotkeys



Google More Specific



Let’s say we want a report of a company. We can simple typ type in “Company Name * “Annual Report” filetype:pdf”  and it should be somewhere in the front page.



This: * is to fill in the blanks between words.



The parentheses “” and the search must cointaint that word or sentence.



2020..2022 means  within the range of 2020..2022 meaning we should only get those years annual reports in search.



So if we wouldnt see any annual reports we can type in “annual report”



Google something like “company name site:reddit.com” do only find in that specific webpage



Type - before a word to exclude it from search.

Google Advanced Search - https://www.google.com/advanced_search



Using forums like reddit could provide useful. Just make sure the forums are not bias, so I prefer reddit.



Google Spreadsheets



Any Spreadsheets will do but I prefer google drive since it’s in the cloud



Since we sometimes have to calculate ourselves and rely on several years of data it’s alot easier to make a graph or just write them down.



Because it’s easy to forget or not see the whole picture.



Settings



Fixing our settings and making our device run more smoothly will in turn result in higher productivity.



In google we can change so for example every page we go into goes to a separate tab. Making us able to open up more pages for the same search. Or just use the middle mouse button.



In the browser we can set up startup pages, making us even more ready.



Startup programs in windows do so we have less annoying crap distracting us at the start of the computer and forcing us to have to turn it off



Automation



The tool we use to conduct our research is a machine capable of automation. We always have to keep that in mind.



When we make our device work more smothless we will in turn do more productive research.



If we do repetitive tasks some can be automated, if not all. Windows Task Scheduler is a great tool for some automation.



Whenever we do a repetitive task we have to think for ourself if a computer could do it. In some cases their are people that have already automated that task.
