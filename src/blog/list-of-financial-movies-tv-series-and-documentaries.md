This series is very well made and about a hedge fund. It can be very hard to understand so it would take a few episodes and some re-watching to understand it all. At least for me.
 
But at some point, you will love and hate almost every character in the show. And it does a great job at showing a more brutal reality.

About black Monday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost almost 22% in a single day.
