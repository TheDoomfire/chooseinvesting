List of Financial Movies, TV Series, and Documentaries
 
Full list of every financial movie, TV series, and documentary I could find. Currently a total of 26 but growing.
 
Some may not be as good as others but hope you will find anything interesting here.
 
Not in any order.

## Movies:

This movie exposes a great scam that shows how flawed and corrupt the market is.
 
### The Wolf of Wallstreet
 
This may be hard to believe but this movie is based on actual events and people.
 
### Boiler Room
 
Way back before the great recession, it takes place. This movie is loosely based on characters from The Wolf of Wallstreet.
 
### Too Big to Fail
 
The name means that the economic fallout would be too dramatic if it collapsed. If a bank that’s too big to fail fails it does not just mean problems for the bank but a hell of a lot more.
 
### Margin Call
 
This movie takes place during the early stages of the 2008 great recession. Loved it.
 
“Explain it to me as you would to a small child, or a golden retriever”

### Moneyball 
 
How people who had nothing to do with baseball. Had a theory on how to use statistics and probability to find undervalued players.
 
And then finally a baseball captain tries this method.
 
Based on a true story.

### Inside Job 2010
 
Yet another 2008 financial documentary that’s about the systematic corruption in America. I find this documentary being a bit complex.
 
### Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room
 
Based on the book with the same name. Explains in simple terms about an American company that was a scam.
 
Very interesting that a company of that size was involved in so many criminal scams.
 
### Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps
 
Or better known as “Wall Street 2”
 
Around the 2008 financial crisis
 
## TV Series:
 
### Billions
 
This series is very well made and about a hedge fund. It can be very hard to understand so it would take a few episodes and some re-watching to understand it all. At least for me.
 
But at some point, you will love and hate almost every character in the show. And it does a great job at showing a more brutal reality.
 
### Black Monday
 
About black Monday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost almost 22% in a single day.
 
This happened in 1987. And computerized trading was a pretty new thing that aided in that massive drop.
 
## Documentaries:
 
### Black Wednesday
 
Black Wednesday refers to September 16, 1992. When the UK government had to withdraw from the European Exchange Rate. Because their currency pound declined massively.
 
### Inside the Meltdown
 
About the 2008 recession.
 
### Capitalism: A Love Story
 
Showing the system and idea that American corporations are executing. And what the public has to pay for it. The capitalist system in America differs from a lot of other countries.
 
### The Corporation
 
Long and interesting documentary about what is a corporation. And how do they affect our daily lives? Even compare corporations to sociopaths in a brilliant matter. A long and interesting
 
Based on the book.
 
### Dirty Money: Drug Short - Documentary Series
 
Maybe you have heard of Martin Shkreli that raised the price of a life-saving drug by 5455%. Big pharmaceuticals are allowed to do this in America and that's kinda messed up.
 
### Floored
 
Before computer trading, there was a trading floor and the job was very stressful. And then computer trading came to be.
 
### Freakonomics
 
A great introduction to economics.
 
Based on the book
 
And there are three books. "Freakonomics", "Superfreakonomics", and "Think Like a Freak".
 
Even have a podcast
 
### The China Hustle
 
It’s about American scammers that preyed on small Chinese companies to fool investors.
 
### Million Dollar Traders (3-part series)
 
12 wannabe traders are given $1 million and then the financial crisis happens.
 
### Mind Over Money
 
Why did mainstream economics fail to predict the 2008 financial crash?
 
Human psychology and the financial market. Can markets be rational when humans aren't?
 
### Money & Speed: Inside the Black Box
 
About the trading market. It's scary to see how the big traders can “gamble” and if enough of them make bad bets, the public has to pay for it.
 
### Money For Nothing
 
American federal reserve and how it affects our society.
 
### Quants: The Alchemists Of Wall Street
 
Quants are math guys that focus on the quantitative part of the business. Some of these guys are smart and it’s kinda depressing that they work for the CEO.
 
Today's einstein may very well be working for a CEO on wall street.
 
### The Trillion Dollar Bet
 
The history behind one of the greatest financial formulas Black-Scholes-Merton options pricing model. Where two of its creators were awarded the Nobel Prize for this formula.
 
And they created a hedge fund together. Which failed massively.
 
### The Wall Street Code
 
About an algorithm builder and high-frequency trading.
 
### Wall Street Warriors (series)
 
A documentary series that suits people who like wall street and trading. They do cover pre and after the 2008 crash.
